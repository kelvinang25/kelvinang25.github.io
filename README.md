Approaches utilized Capstone Project (EDA):

1) Search through several sites like:
  - Kraggle
  - UCI
  - Data.sg
  - Alibaba
  
2) Identified consumer behavior log dataset from Alibaba and decided to download for EDA.

3) Initial EDA findings:
  - 3 dataset:
       i)   User view information (5,556,714, 3)
       ii)  User pay information (69,674,109, 3)
       iii) Shop information (2000 x 10)

Checked Missing and NaN Data Replacement:
The data was clean and did not fine any missing information.

Combined User view and User pay to create a single data frame

Down sample for easy analysis and data experimentation because after combination the data frame ballooned to 75 million.
